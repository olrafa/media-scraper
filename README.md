## Media-scraper

This is a small script that will run at fixed intervals to scrape the home pages of main media sites from Brazil, searching for a certain keyword. Whenever it finds the keywords, it adds a record to a database.

The keyword in case here is "Neymar", and the results are visible at [Neymarmeter](https://neymarmeter.vercel.app/). You can check the repo [here](https://github.com/olrafa/neymarmeter/).
